<h2>The English alphabet</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Here you need to prepare a <code class="java">StringBuilder</code> that produces all English letters in the uppercase (<code class="java">A-Z</code>). All the letters should be separated by one space, but there shouldn't be a space after the last letter. Despite the possibility to solve this problem without a <code class="java">StringBuilder</code>at all, we highly recommend you to use it to get more practice.</p>
